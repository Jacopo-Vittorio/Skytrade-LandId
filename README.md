Parcel Land Detective: Uncover the Secrets of Your Neighborhood! ️‍♀️
This code is your personal James Bond, ready to infiltrate the world of parcels! Want to know who owns the land next door, or discover hidden plots lurking in the shadows? This script's got you covered.

Here's the lowdown:

Secret Agent Setup:

You'll need some intel (latitude & longitude) and access credentials (auth token & email, but those are currently classified ).
Mission: Intercept!

The code acts like a secret agent, intercepting messages to the "parcels.id.land" website.
Data Extraction: ️‍♀️

Once the intel is gathered, the code extracts valuable info like parcel IDs, owner names, and even fancy land shapes (polygons) described in a secret code called WKT.
Mission Report:

All the juicy details are compiled into a neat JSON file, ready for your analysis.
How to Use This Code:

Gear Up:

Make sure you have Python and the playwright library installed.
Fill in the Blanks: ✏️

Replace the lng, lat, auth_token, and auth_email placeholders with your actual intel. (Remember, keep those access credentials secret!)
Run the Mission:

Save the code as a Python file (e.g., parcel_detective.py) and run it from the command line: python parcel_detective.py
Analyze Your Findings:

Open the test_json.json file to see the extracted data in a clear JSON format.
Disclaimer: ⚠️

While this code is built for exploration, remember to be respectful of privacy laws and regulations. Don't use this script for any malicious purposes!
